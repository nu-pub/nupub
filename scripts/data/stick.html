  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    <span>MIKE EBERSOLD GOT CALLED</span> into a hospital emergency room one
    afternoon late in 2011 to examine a Wisconsin deer hunter who’d been found
    lying unconscious in a cornfield. The man had blood at the back of his head,
    and the men who’d found and brought him in supposed he’d maybe stumbled and
    cracked his skull on something.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ebersold is a neurosurgeon. The injury had brain protruding, and he
    recognized it as a gunshot wound. The hunter regained consciousness in the
    ER, but when asked how he’d hurt himself, he had no idea.
  </p>
  <p>
    Recounting the incident later, Ebersold said, “Somebody from some distance
    away must have fired what appeared to be a 12-gauge shotgun, which arced
    over God only knows what distance, hit this guy in the back of his head,
    fractured his skull, and lodged into the brain about an inch. It must have
    been pretty much spent, or it would have gone deeper.”<sup
      ><a href="#calibre_link-110">1</a></sup
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    <a></a>Ebersold is tall, slender, and counts among his forebears the Dakota
    chiefs named Wapasha and the French fur traders named Rocque who populated
    this part of the Mississippi River Valley where the Mayo brothers would
    later found their famous clinic. Ebersold’s formal training included four
    years of college, four years of medical school, and seven years of
    neurosurgery training&mdash;building a foundation of knowledge and skills
    that has been broadened and deepened through continuing medical education
    classes, consultations with his colleagues, and his practice at the Mayo
    Clinic and elsewhere. He carries himself with a midwestern modesty that
    belies a career that counts a long list of high-profile patients who have
    sought out his services. When President Ronald Reagan needed treatment for
    injuries after a fall from his horse, Ebersold participated in the surgery
    and postsurgical care. When Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, president of
    the United Arab Emirates, needed delicate spinal repair, he and what seemed
    like half the nation’s ministry and security forces settled in Rochester
    while Mike Ebersold made the repair and oversaw Zayed’s recovery. Following
    a long career at Mayo, Mike had returned to help out at the clinic in
    Wisconsin, feeling indebted to it for his early medical training. The hunter
    whose bad luck put him in the way of an errant 12-gauge slug was luckier
    than he likely knows that Mike was on the job that day.
  </p>
  <p>
    The bullet had entered an area of the skull beneath which there is a large
    venous sinus, a soft-tissue channel that drains the brain cavity. As he
    examined the hunter, Ebersold knew from experience that when he opened up
    the wound, there was a high probability he would find this vein was torn. As
    he described it,
  </p>
  <div></div>
  <p>
    You say to yourself, “This patient is going to need surgery. There’s brain
    coming out of the wound. We have to clean this <a></a>up and repair this as
    best we can, but in so doing we may get into this big vein and that could be
    very, very serious.” So you go through the checklist. You say, “I might need
    a blood transfusion for this patient,” so you set up some blood. You review
    the steps, A, B, C, and D. You set up the operating room, telling them ahead
    of time what you might be encountering. All of this is sort of protocol,
    pretty much like a cop getting ready to pull over a car, you know what the
    book says, you’ve gone through all these steps.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then you get to the operating room, and now you’re still in this mode where
    you have time to think through it. You say, “Gee, I don’t want to just go
    and pull that bullet out if there might be major bleeding. What I’ll try to
    do is I’ll work around the edges and get things freed up so I’m ready for
    what could go wrong, and then I’ll pull it out.”
  </p>
  <div></div>
  <p>
    It turned out that the bullet and bone were lodged in the vein, serving as
    plugs, another lucky turn for the hunter. If the wound hadn’t corked itself
    in the field, he would not have lived for more than two or three minutes.
    When Ebersold removed the bullet, the fractured bone chips fell away, and
    the vein let loose in a torrent. “Within five minutes, you’ve lost two or so
    units of blood and now you sort of transfer out of the mode where you’re
    thinking through this, going through the options. Now it becomes reflex,
    mechanical. You know it’s going to bleed very, very much, so you have a very
    short time. You’re just thinking, ‘I have to get a suture around this
    structure, and I know from previous experience I have to do it in this
    particular way.’ ”
  </p>
  <p>
    The vein in question, which is about the size of an adult’s small finger,
    was torn in several places over a distance of about an inch and a half. It
    needed to be tied off above and below the rupture, but it’s a flat structure
    that he knows well: you <a></a>can’t just put a stitch around it, because
    when you tighten it, the tissue tears, and the ligature leaks. Working
    urgently and mechanically, he fell back on a technique he’d developed out of
    necessity in past surgeries involving this vein. He cut two little pieces of
    muscle, from where the patient’s skin had been opened up in surgery, and
    imported them to the site and stitched the ends of the torn vein to them.
    These plugs of muscle served to close the vein without deflecting its
    natural shape or tearing its tissue. It’s a solution Mike has taught
    himself&mdash;one he says you won’t find written anywhere, but handy in the
    moment, to say the least. In the sixty or so seconds it took to do, the
    patient lost another two hundred cubic centimeters of blood, but once the
    plugs were in place, the bleeding stopped. “Some people can’t tolerate this
    sinus vein being closed off. They get increased brain pressure because the
    blood doesn’t drain properly. But this patient was one of the fortunate who
    can.” The hunter left the hospital a week later. He was minus some
    peripheral vision but otherwise remarkably unscathed from a very close brush
    with mortality.
  </p>
  <div></div>
  <h1>Reflection Is a Form of Practice</h1>
  <p>
    What inferences can we draw from this story about how we learn and remember?
    In neurosurgery (and, arguably, in all aspects of life from the moment you
    leave the womb), there’s an essential kind of learning that comes from
    reflection on personal experience. Ebersold described it this way:
  </p>
  <div></div>
  <p>
    A lot of times something would come up in surgery that I had difficulty
    with, and then I’d go home that night thinking about what happened and what
    could I do, for example, to improve the way a suturing went. How can I take
    a bigger bite with my needle, or a smaller bite, or should the stitches be
    closer together? What if I modified it this way or that way? Then the
    <a></a>next day back, I’d try that and see if it worked better. Or even if
    it wasn’t the next day, at least I’ve thought through this, and in so doing
    I’ve not only revisited things that I learned from lectures or from watching
    others performing surgery but also I’ve complemented that by adding
    something of my own to it that I missed during the teaching process.
  </p>
  <div></div>
  <p>
    Reflection can involve several cognitive activities that lead to stronger
    learning: retrieving knowledge and earlier training from memory, connecting
    these to new experiences, and visualizing and mentally rehearsing what you
    might do differently next time.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was this kind of reflection that originally had led Ebersold to try a new
    technique for repairing the sinus vein at the back of the head, a technique
    he practiced in his mind and in the operating room until it became the kind
    of reflexive maneuver you can depend on when your patient is spouting blood
    at two hundred cubic centimeters a minute.
  </p>
  <p>
    To make sure the new learning is available when it’s needed, Ebersold points
    out, “you memorize the list of things that you need to worry about in a
    given situation: steps A, B, C, and D,” and you drill on them. Then there
    comes a time when you get into a tight situation and it’s no longer a matter
    of thinking through the steps, it’s a matter of reflexively taking the
    correct action. “Unless you keep recalling this maneuver, it will not become
    a reflex. Like a race car driver in a tight situation or a quarterback
    dodging a tackle, you’ve got to act out of reflex before you’ve even had
    time to think. Recalling it over and over, practicing it over and over.
    That’s just so important.”
  </p>
  <div></div>
  <h1><a></a>The Testing Effect</h1>
  <p>
    A child stringing cranberries on a thread goes to hang them on the tree,
    only to find they’ve slipped off the other end. Without the knot, there’s no
    making a string. Without the knot there’s no necklace, there’s no beaded
    purse, no magnificent tapestry. Retrieval ties the knot for memory. Repeated
    retrieval snugs it up and adds a loop to make it fast.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since as far back as 1885, psychologists have been plotting “forgetting
    curves” that illustrate just how fast our cranberries slip off the string.
    In very short order we lose something like 70 percent of what we’ve just
    heard or read. After that, forgetting begins to slow, and the last 30
    percent or so falls away more slowly, but the lesson is clear: a central
    challenge to improving the way we learn is finding a way to interrupt the
    process of forgetting.<sup><a href="#calibre_link-111">2</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    The power of retrieval as a learning tool is known among psychologists as
    the testing effect. In its most common form, testing is used to measure
    learning and assign grades in school, but we’ve long known that the act of
    retrieving knowledge from memory has the effect of making that knowledge
    easier to call up again in the future. In his essay on memory, Aristotle
    wrote: “exercise in repeatedly recalling a thing strengthens the memory.”
    Francis Bacon wrote about this phenomenon, as did the psychologist William
    James. Today, we know from empirical research that practicing retrieval
    makes learning stick far better than reexposure to the original material
    does. This is the testing effect, also known as the retrieval-practice
    effect.<sup><a href="#calibre_link-112">3</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    To be most effective, retrieval must be repeated again and again, in spaced
    out sessions so that the recall, rather than becoming a mindless recitation,
    requires some cognitive effort. Repeated recall appears to help memory
    consolidate into a cohesive representation in the brain and to strengthen
    and <a></a>multiply the neural routes by which the knowledge can later be
    retrieved. In recent decades, studies have confirmed what Mike Ebersold and
    every seasoned quarterback, jet pilot, and teenaged texter knows from
    experience&mdash;that repeated retrieval can so embed knowledge and skills
    that they become reflexive: the brain acts before the mind has time to
    think.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet despite what research and personal experience tell us about the power of
    testing as a learning tool, teachers and students in traditional educational
    settings rarely use it as such, and the technique remains little understood
    or utilized by teachers or students as a learning tool in traditional
    educational settings. Far from it.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 2010 the <span>New York Times</span> reported on a scientific study that
    showed that students who read a passage of text and then took a test asking
    them to recall what they had read retained an astonishing 50 percent more of
    the information a week later than students who had not been tested. This
    would seem like good news, but here’s how it was greeted in many online
    comments:
  </p>
  <div></div>
  <p>
    “Once again, another author confuses learning with recalling information.”
  </p>
  <div></div>
  <p>
    “I personally would like to avoid as many tests as possible, especially with
    my grade on the line. Trying to learn in a stressful environment is no way
    to help retain information.”
  </p>
  <div></div>
  <p>
    “Nobody should care whether memorization is enhanced by practice testing or
    not. Our children cannot <span>do</span> much of anything anymore.”<sup
      ><a href="#calibre_link-113">4</a></sup
    >
  </p>
  <div></div>
  <p>
    Forget memorization, many commenters argued; education should be about
    high-order skills. Hmmm. If memorization is irrelevant to complex problem
    solving, don’t tell your <a></a>neurosurgeon. The frustration many people
    feel toward standardized, “dipstick” tests given for the sole purpose of
    measuring learning is understandable, but it steers us away from
    appreciating one of the most potent learning tools available to us. Pitting
    the learning of basic knowledge against the development of creative thinking
    is a false choice. Both need to be cultivated. The stronger one’s knowledge
    about the subject at hand, the more nuanced one’s creativity can be in
    addressing a new problem. Just as knowledge amounts to little without the
    exercise of ingenuity and imagination, creativity absent a sturdy foundation
    of knowledge builds a shaky house.
  </p>
  <div></div>
  <h1>Studying the Testing Effect in the Lab</h1>
  <p>
    The testing effect has a solid pedigree in empirical research. The first
    large-scale investigation was published in 1917. Children in grades 3, 5, 6,
    and 8 studied brief biographies from <span>Who’s Who in America.</span> Some
    of them were directed to spend varying lengths of the study time looking up
    from the material and silently reciting to themselves what it contained.
    Those who did not do so simply continued to reread the material. At the end
    of the period, all the children were asked to write down what they could
    remember. The recall test was repeated three to four hours later. All the
    groups who had engaged in the recitation showed better retention than those
    who had not done so but had merely continued to review the material. The
    best results were from those spending about 60 percent of the study time in
    recitation.
  </p>
  <p>
    A second landmark study, published in 1939, tested over three thousand sixth
    graders across Iowa. The kids studied six-hundred-word articles and then
    took tests at various times before a final test two months later. The
    experiment showed a couple of interesting results: the longer the first test
    was delayed, the greater the forgetting, and second, once a student
    <a></a>had taken a test, the forgetting nearly stopped, and the student’s
    score on subsequent tests dropped very little.<sup
      ><a href="#calibre_link-114">5</a></sup
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    Around 1940, interest turned to the study of forgetting, and investigating
    the potential of testing as a form of retrieval practice and as a learning
    tool fell out of favor. So did the use of testing as a research tool: since
    testing interrupts forgetting, you can’t use it to measure forgetting
    because that “contaminates” the subject.
  </p>
  <p>
    Interest in the testing effect resurfaced in 1967 with the publication of a
    study showing that research subjects who were presented with lists of
    thirty-six words learned as much from repeated testing after initial
    exposure to the words as they did from repeated studying. These
    results&mdash;that testing led to as much learning as studying
    did&mdash;challenged the received wisdom, turned researchers’ attention back
    to the potential of testing as a learning tool, and stimulated a boomlet in
    testing research.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 1978, researchers found that massed studying (cramming) leads to higher
    scores on an immediate test but results in faster forgetting compared to
    practicing retrieval. In a second test two days after an initial test, the
    crammers had forgotten 50 percent of what they had been able to recall on
    the initial test, while those who had spent the same period practicing
    retrieval instead of studying had forgotten only 13 percent of the
    information recalled initially.
  </p>
  <p>
    A subsequent study was aimed at understanding what effect taking multiple
    tests would have on subjects’ long-term retention. Students heard a story
    that named sixty concrete objects. Those students who were tested
    immediately after exposure recalled 53 percent of the objects on this
    initial test but only 39 percent a week later. On the other hand, a group of
    students who learned the same material but were not tested at all until a
    week later recalled 28 percent. Thus, taking a single test boosted
    performance by 11 percent after a week. <a></a>But what effect would three
    immediate tests have relative to one? Another group of students were tested
    three times after initial exposure and a week later they were able to recall
    53 percent of the objects&mdash;the same as on the initial test for the
    group receiving one test. In effect, the group that received three tests had
    been “immunized” against forgetting, compared to the one-test group, and the
    one-test group remembered more than those who had received no test
    immediately following exposure. Thus, and in agreement with later research,
    multiple sessions of retrieval practice are generally better than one,
    especially if the test sessions are spaced out.<sup
      ><a href="#calibre_link-115">6</a></sup
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    In another study, researchers showed that simply asking a subject to fill in
    a word’s missing letters resulted in better memory of the word. Consider a
    list of word pairs. For a pair like <span>foot</span>-<span>shoe,</span>
    those who studied the pair intact had lower subsequent recall than those who
    studied the pair from a clue as obvious as <span>foot</span>-<span
      >s_ _e.</span
    >
    This experiment was a demonstration of what researchers call the “generation
    effect.” The modest effort required to generate the cued answer while
    studying the pairs strengthened memory of the target word tested later
    (shoe). Interestingly, this study found that the ability to recall the word
    pair on later tests was greater if the practice retrieval was delayed by
    twenty intervening word pairs than when it came immediately after first
    studying the pair.<sup><a href="#calibre_link-116">7</a></sup> Why would
    that be? One argument suggested that the greater effort required by the
    delayed recall solidified the memory better. Researchers began to ask
    whether the schedule of testing mattered.
  </p>
  <p>
    The answer is yes. When retrieval practice is spaced, allowing some
    forgetting to occur between tests, it leads to stronger long-term retention
    than when it is massed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Researchers began looking for opportunities to take their inquiries out of
    the lab and into the classroom, using the kinds of materials students are
    required to learn in school.
  </p>
  <div></div>
  <h1><a></a>Studying the Testing Effect “In the Wild”</h1>
  <p>
    In 2005, we and our colleagues approached Roger Chamberlain, the principal
    of a middle school in nearby Columbia, Illinois, with a proposition. The
    positive effects of retrieval practice had been demonstrated many times in
    controlled laboratory settings but rarely in a regular classroom setting.
    Would the principal, teachers, kids, and parents of Columbia Middle School
    be willing subjects in a study to see how the testing effect would work “in
    the wild”?
  </p>
  <p>
    Chamberlain had concerns. If this was just about memorization, he wasn’t
    especially interested. His aim is to raise the school’s students to higher
    forms of learning&mdash;analysis, synthesis, and application, as he put it.
    And he was concerned about his teachers, an energetic faculty with curricula
    and varied instructional methods he was loath to disrupt. On the other hand,
    the study’s results could be instructive, and participation would bring
    enticements in the form of smart boards and “clickers”&mdash;automated
    response systems&mdash;for the classrooms of participating teachers. Money
    for new technology is famously tight.
  </p>
  <p>
    A sixth grade social studies teacher, Patrice Bain, was eager to give it a
    try. For the researchers, a chance to work in the classroom was compelling,
    and the school’s terms were accepted: the study would be minimally intrusive
    by fitting within existing curricula, lesson plans, test formats, and
    teaching methods. The same textbooks would be used. The only difference in
    the class would be the introduction of occasional short quizzes. The study
    would run for three semesters (a year and a half), through several chapters
    of the social studies textbook, covering topics such as ancient Egypt,
    Mesopotamia, India, and China. The project was launched in 2006. It would
    prove to be a good decision.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a></a>For the six social studies classes a research assistant, Pooja
    Agarwal, designed a series of quizzes that would test students on roughly
    one-third of the material covered by the teacher. These quizzes were for “no
    stakes,” meaning that scores were not counted toward a grade. The teacher
    excused herself from the classroom for each quiz so as to remain unaware of
    which material was being tested. One quiz was given at the start of class,
    on material from assigned reading that hadn’t yet been discussed. A second
    was given at the end of class after the teacher had covered the material for
    the day’s lesson. And a review quiz was given twenty-four hours before each
    unit exam.
  </p>
  <p>
    There was concern that if students tested better in the final exam on
    material that had been quizzed than on material not quizzed, it could be
    argued that the simple act of reexposing them to the material in the quizzes
    was responsible for the superior learning, not the retrieval practice. To
    counter this possibility, some of the nonquizzed material was interspersed
    with the quiz material, provided as simple review statements, like “The Nile
    River has two major tributaries: the White Nile and the Blue Nile,” with no
    retrieval required. The facts were quizzed for some classes but just
    restudied for others.
  </p>
  <p>
    The quizzes took only a few minutes of classroom time. After the teacher
    stepped out of the room, Agarwal projected a series of slides onto the board
    at the front of the room and read them to the students. Each slide presented
    either a multiple choice question or a statement of fact. When the slide
    contained a question, students used clickers (handheld, cell-phone-like
    remotes) to indicate their answer choice: A, B, C, or D. When all had
    responded, the correct answer was revealed, so as to provide feedback and
    correct errors. (Although teachers were not present for these quizzes, under
    normal circumstances, <a></a>with teachers administering quizzes, they would
    see immediately how well students are tracking the study material and use
    the results to guide further discussion or study.)
  </p>
  <p>
    Unit exams were the normal pencil-and-paper tests given by the teacher.
    Exams were also given at the end of the semester and at the end of the year.
    Students had been exposed to all of the material tested in these exams
    through the teacher’s normal classroom lessons, homework, worksheets, and so
    on, but they had also been quizzed three times on one-third of the material,
    and they had seen another third presented for additional study three times.
    The balance of the material was neither quizzed nor additionally reviewed in
    class beyond the initial lesson and whatever reading a student may have
    done.
  </p>
  <p>
    The results were compelling: The kids scored a full grade level higher on
    the material that had been quizzed than on the material that had not been
    quizzed. Moreover, test results for the material that had been reviewed as
    statements of fact but not quizzed were no better than those for the
    nonreviewed material. Again, mere rereading does not much help.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 2007, the research was extended to eighth grade science classes, covering
    genetics, evolution, and anatomy. The regimen was the same, and the results
    equally impressive. At the end of three semesters, the eighth graders
    averaged 79 percent (C<span>+</span>) on the science material that had not
    been quizzed, compared to 92 percent (A<span>−</span>) on the material that
    had been quizzed.
  </p>
  <p>
    The testing effect persisted eight months later at the end-of-year exams,
    confirming what many laboratory studies have shown about the long-term
    benefits of retrieval practice. The effect doubtless would have been greater
    if the retrieval practice had continued and occurred once a month, say, in
    the intervening months.<sup><a href="#calibre_link-117">8</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    <a></a>The lesson from these studies has been taken to heart by many of the
    teachers at Columbia Middle School. Long after concluding their
    participation in the research studies, Patrice Bain’s sixth grade social
    studies classes continue today to follow a schedule of quizzes before
    lessons, quizzes after lessons, and then a review quiz prior to the chapter
    test. Jon Wehrenberg, an eighth grade history teacher who was not part of
    the research, has knitted retrieval practice into his classroom in many
    different forms, including quizzing, and he provides additional online tools
    at his website, like flashcards and games. After reading passages on the
    history of slavery, for example, his students are asked to write down ten
    facts about slavery they hadn’t known before reading the passages. You don’t
    need electronic gadgetry to practice retrieval.
  </p>
  <p>
    Seven sixth and seventh graders needing to improve their reading and
    comprehension skills sat in Michelle Spivey’s English classroom one period
    recently with their reading books open to an amusing story. Each student was
    invited to read a paragraph aloud. Where a student stumbled, Miss Spivey had
    him try again. When he’d gotten it right, she probed the class to explain
    the meaning of the passage and what might have been going on in the
    characters’ minds. Retrieval and elaboration; again, no technology required.
  </p>
  <p>
    Quizzes at Columbia Middle School are not onerous events. Following
    completion of the research studies, students’ views were surveyed on this
    question. Sixty-four percent said the quizzing reduced their anxiety over
    unit exams, and 89 percent felt it increased learning. The kids expressed
    disappointment on days when clickers were not used, because the activity
    broke up the teacher’s lecture and proved enjoyable.
  </p>
  <p>
    Principal Chamberlain, when asked what he thought the study results
    indicated, replied simply: “Retrieval practice has a significant impact on
    kids’ learning. This is telling us that <a></a>it’s valuable, and that
    teachers are well advised to incorporate it into their instructional
    technique.”<sup><a href="#calibre_link-118">9</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p>Are similar effects found at a later age?</p>
  <p>
    Andrew Sobel teaches a class in international political economics at
    Washington University in St. Louis, a lecture course populated by
    160&ndash;170 students, mostly freshmen and sophomores. Over a period of
    several years he noticed a growing problem with attendance. On any given day
    by midsemester, 25&ndash;35 percent of the class would be absent, compared
    to earlier in the semester when maybe 10 percent would be absent. The
    problem wasn’t unique to his class, he says. A lot of professors give
    students their PowerPoint slides, so the students just stop coming to class.
    Sobel fought back by withholding his slides, but by the end of the semester,
    many students stopped showing up anyway. The class syllabus included two big
    tests, a midterm and a final. Looking for some way to leverage attendance,
    Sobel replaced the big tests with nine pop quizzes. Because the quizzes
    would determine the course grade and would be unannounced, students would be
    well advised to show up for class.
  </p>
  <p>
    The results were distressing. Over the semester, a third or more of the
    students bailed out. “I really got hammered in the teaching reviews,” Sobel
    told us. “The kids hated it. If they didn’t do well on a quiz they dropped
    the course rather than get a bad grade in it. Of those who stayed, I got
    this bifurcation between those who actually showed up and did the work, and
    those who didn’t. I found myself handing out A-plusses, which I’d never
    given before, and more Cs than I’d ever given.”<sup
      ><a href="#calibre_link-119">10</a></sup
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    With so much pushback, he had little choice but to drop the experiment and
    reinstate the old format, lectures with a midterm and final. A couple of
    years later, however, after hearing a <a></a>presentation about the learning
    benefits of testing, he added a third major test during the semester to see
    what effect it might have on his students’ learning. They did better, but
    not by as much as he’d hoped, and the attendance problems persisted.
  </p>
  <p>
    He scratched his head and changed the syllabus once again. This time he
    announced that there would be nine quizzes during the semester, and he was
    explicit about when they would be. No surprises, and no midterm or final
    exams, because he didn’t want to give up that much of his lecture time.
  </p>
  <p>
    Despite fears that enrollments would plummet again, they actually increased
    by a handful. “Unlike the pop quizzes, which kids hate, these were all on
    the syllabus. If they missed one it was their own fault. It wasn’t because I
    surprised them or was being pernicious. They were comfortable with that.”
    Sobel took satisfaction in seeing attendance improve as well. “They would
    skip some classes on the days they didn’t have a quiz, particularly the
    spring semester, but they showed up for the quizzes.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Like the course, the quizzes were cumulative, and the questions were similar
    to those on the exams he used to give, but the quality of the answers he was
    getting by midsemester was much better than he was accustomed to seeing on
    the midterms. Five years into this new format, he’s sold on it. “The quality
    of discussions in class has gone way up. I see that big a difference in
    their written work, just by going from three exams to nine quizzes.” By the
    end of the semester he has them writing paragraphs on the concepts covered
    in class, sometimes a full-page essay, and the quality is comparable to what
    he’s seeing in his upper division classes.
  </p>
  <p>
    “Anybody can design this structure. But I also realize that, Oh, god, if I’d
    done this years ago I would have taught them that much more stuff. The
    interesting thing about adopting this strategy is I now recognize that as
    good a teacher as I <a></a>might think I am, my teaching is only a component
    of their learning, and how I structure it has a lot to do with it, maybe
    even more.” Meanwhile, the course enrollment has grown to 185 and counting.

  <h1>Exploring Nuances</h1>
  <p>
    Andy Sobel’s example is anecdotal and likely reflects a variety of
    beneficial influences, not least being the cumulative learning effects that
    accrue like compounded interest when course material is carried forward in a
    regime of quizzes across an entire semester. Nonetheless, his experience
    squares with empirical research designed to tease apart the effects and
    nuances of testing.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, in one experiment college students studied prose passages on
    various scientific topics like those taught in college and then either took
    an immediate recall test after the initial exposure or restudied the
    material. After a delay of two days, the students who took the initial test
    recalled more of the material than those who simply restudied it (68 v. 54
    percent), and this advantage was sustained a week later (56 v. 42 percent).
    Another experiment found that after one week a study-only group showed the
    most forgetting of what they initially had been able to recall, forgetting
    52 percent, compared to a repeated-testing group, who forgot only 10
    percent.<sup><a href="#calibre_link-120">11</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    How does giving feedback on wrong answers to test questions affect learning?
    Studies show that giving feedback strengthens retention more than testing
    alone does, and, interestingly, some evidence shows that delaying the
    feedback briefly produces better long-term learning than immediate feedback.
    This finding is counterintuitive but is consistent with researchers’
    <a></a>discoveries about how we learn motor tasks, like making layups or
    driving a golf ball toward a distant green. In motor learning, trial and
    error with delayed feedback is a more awkward but effective way of acquiring
    a skill than trial and correction through immediate feedback; immediate
    feedback is like the training wheels on a bicycle: the learner quickly comes
    to depend on the continued presence of the correction.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the case of learning motor skills, one theory holds that when there’s
    immediate feedback it comes to be part of the task, so that later, in a
    real-world setting, its absence becomes a gap in the established pattern
    that disrupts performance. Another idea holds that frequent interruptions
    for feedback make the learning sessions too variable, preventing
    establishment of a stabilized pattern of performance.<sup
      ><a href="#calibre_link-121">12</a></sup
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    In the classroom, delayed feedback also yields better long-term learning
    than immediate feedback does. In the case of the students studying prose
    passages on science topics, some were shown the passage again even while
    they were asked to answer questions about it, in effect providing them with
    continuous feedback during the test, analogous to an open-book exam. The
    other group took the test without the study material at hand and only
    afterward were given the passage and instructed to look over their
    responses. Of course, the open-book group performed best on the immediate
    test, but those who got corrective feedback after completing the test
    retained the learning better on a later test. Delayed feedback on written
    tests may help because it gives the student practice that’s spaced out in
    time; as discussed in the next chapter, spacing practice improves
    retention.<sup><a href="#calibre_link-122">13</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    Are some kinds of retrieval practice more effective for long-term learning
    than others? Tests that require the learner to <a></a>supply the answer,
    like an essay or short-answer test, or simply practice with flashcards,
    appear to be more effective than simple recognition tests like multiple
    choice or true/false tests. However, even multiple choice tests like those
    used at Columbia Middle School can yield strong benefits. While any kind of
    retrieval practice generally benefits learning, the implication seems to be
    that where more cognitive effort is required for retrieval, greater
    retention results. Retrieval practice has been studied extensively in recent
    years, and an analysis of these studies shows that even a single test in a
    class can produce a large improvement in final exam scores, and gains in
    learning continue to increase as the number of tests increases.<sup
      ><a href="#calibre_link-123">14</a></sup
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    Whichever theories science eventually tells us are correct about
    <span>how</span> repeated retrieval strengthens memory, empirical research
    shows us that the testing effect is real&mdash;that the act of retrieving a
    memory changes the memory, making it easier to retrieve again later.
  </p>
  <p>
    How widely is retrieval practice used as a study technique? In one survey,
    college students were largely unaware of its effectiveness. In another
    survey, only 11 percent of college students said they use this study
    strategy. Even when they did report testing themselves, they mostly said
    they did it to discover what they didn’t know, so they could study that
    material more. That’s a perfectly valid use of testing, but few students
    realize that retrieval itself creates greater retention.<sup
      ><a href="#calibre_link-124">15</a></sup
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    Is repeated testing simply a way to expedite rote learning? In fact,
    research indicates that testing, compared to rereading, can facilitate
    better transfer of knowledge to new contexts and problems, and that it
    improves one’s ability to retain and <a></a>retrieve material that is
    related but not tested. Further research is needed on this point, but it
    seems that retrieval practice can make information more accessible when it
    is needed in various contexts.
  </p>
  <p>
    Do students resist testing as a tool for learning? Students do generally
    dislike the idea of tests, and it’s not hard to see why, in particular in
    the case of high-stakes tests like midterms and finals, where the score
    comes with significant consequences. Yet in all studies of testing that
    reported students’ attitudes, the students who were tested frequently rated
    their classes more favorably at the end of the semester than those tested
    less frequently. Those who were frequently tested reached the end of the
    semester on top of the material and did not need to cram for exams.
  </p>
  <p>
    How does taking a test affect subsequent studying? After a test, students
    spend more time restudying the material they missed, and they learn more
    from it than do their peers who restudy the material without having been
    tested. Students whose study strategies emphasize rereading but not
    self-testing show overconfidence in their mastery. Students who have been
    quizzed have a double advantage over those who have not: a more accurate
    sense of what they know and don’t know, and the strengthening of learning
    that accrues from retrieval practice.<sup
      ><a href="#calibre_link-125">16</a></sup
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    Are there any further, indirect benefits of regular, low-stakes classroom
    testing? Besides strengthening learning and retention, a regime of this kind
    of testing improves student attendance. It increases studying before class
    (because students <a></a>know they’ll be quizzed), increases attentiveness
    during class if students are tested at the end of class, and enables
    students to better calibrate what they know and where they need to bone up.
    It’s an antidote to mistaking fluency with the text, resulting from repeated
    readings, for mastery of the subject. Frequent low-stakes testing helps dial
    down test anxiety among students by diversifying the consequences over a
    much larger sample: no single test is a make-or-break event. And this kind
    of testing enables instructors to identify gaps in students’ understanding
    and adapt their instruction to fill them. These benefits of low-stakes
    testing accrue whether instruction is delivered online or in the
    classroom.<sup><a href="#calibre_link-126">17</a></sup>

  <h1>The Takeaway</h1>
  <p>
    <span
      >Practice at retrieving new knowledge or skill from memory is a potent
      tool for learning and durable retention.</span
    >
    This is true for anything the brain is asked to remember and call up again
    in the future&mdash;facts, complex concepts, problem-solving techniques,
    motor skills.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Effortful retrieval</span> makes for stronger learning and retention.
    We’re easily seduced into believing that learning is better when it’s
    easier, but the research shows the opposite: when the mind has to work,
    learning sticks better. The greater the effort to retrieve learning,
    provided that you succeed, the more that learning is strengthened by
    retrieval. After an initial test,
    <span>delaying subsequent retrieval practice</span> is more potent for
    reinforcing retention than immediate practice, because delayed retrieval
    requires more effort.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Repeated retrieval</span> not only makes memories more durable but
    produces knowledge that can be retrieved more readily, in more varied
    settings, and applied to a wider variety of problems.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a></a>While cramming can produce better scores on an immediate exam, the
    advantage quickly fades because there is much greater forgetting after
    rereading than after retrieval practice. The benefits of retrieval practice
    are <span>long-term.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Simply including one test</span> (retrieval practice) in a class
    yields a large improvement in final exam scores, and gains continue to
    increase as the frequency of classroom testing increases.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Testing doesn’t need to be initiated by the instructor.</span>
    Students can practice retrieval anywhere; no quizzes in the classroom are
    necessary. Think flashcards&mdash;the way second graders learn the
    multiplication tables can work just as well for learners at any age to quiz
    themselves on anatomy, mathematics, or law. Self-testing may be unappealing
    because it takes more effort than rereading, but as noted already, the
    greater the effort at retrieval, the more will be retained.
  </p>
  <p>
    Students who take practice tests have
    <span>a better grasp of their progress</span> than those who simply reread
    the material. Similarly, such testing enables an instructor to
    <span>spot gaps and misconceptions</span> and adapt instruction to correct
    them.
  </p>
  <p>
    Giving students <span>corrective feedback</span> after tests keeps them from
    incorrectly retaining material they have misunderstood and produces better
    learning of the correct answers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Students in classes that incorporate low-stakes quizzing come to embrace the
    practice. Students who are tested frequently rate their classes more
    favorably.
  </p>
  <p>
    What about Principal Roger Chamberlain’s initial concerns about practice
    quizzing at Columbia Middle School&mdash;that it might be nothing more than
    a glorified path to rote learning?
  </p>
  <p>
    When we asked him this question after the study was completed, he paused for
    a moment to gather his thoughts. “What <a></a>I’ve really gained a comfort
    level with is this: for kids to be able to evaluate, synthesize, and apply a
    concept in different settings, they’re going to be much more efficient at
    getting there when they have the base of knowledge and the retention, so
    they’re not wasting time trying to go back and figure out what that word
    might mean or what that concept was about. It allows them to go to a higher
    level.”
